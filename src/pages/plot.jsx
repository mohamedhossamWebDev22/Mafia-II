              Mafia II is an action-adventure game developed by 2K Czech and
              published by 2K. The game is set in the fictional city of Empire Bay
              from 1945 to 1951 and follows the story of Vito Scaletta, a young
              Sicilian-American mobster and war veteran, who becomes caught in a
              power struggle among the city's Mafia crime families while
              attempting to pay back his father's debts and secure a better
              lifestyle ยน. The game is played from a third-person perspective and
              its world is navigated on foot or by vehicle. The player character's
              criminal activities may incite a response from law enforcement
              agencies, measured by a "wanted" system that governs the aggression
              of their response ยน. I hope this helps!
